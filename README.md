# AI-Picture-generate
I am using different AI platforms to generate pictures using prompts. For Graphic or Web design for example. I am using many AI platforms like ChatGpt, Gemini, Leonardo, Microsoft Designer, Remini, Claude, Adobe Express/Firefly...
Also I am using Microsoft Publisher and Adobe Photoshop sometimes for manual corrections.
